# Monolithic Game Download Cache Docker Container

## Introduction

This Rancher stack provides a caching proxy server for game download content. For any network with more than one PC gamer in connected this will drastically reduce internet bandwidth consumption. 

The primary use case is gaming events, such as LAN parties, which need to be able to cope with hundreds or thousands of computers receiving an unannounced patch - without spending a fortune on internet connectivity. Other uses include smaller networks, such as Internet Cafes and home networks, where the new games are regularly installed on multiple computers; or multiple independent operating systems on the same computer.

This stack is designed to support any game that uses HTTP and also supports HTTP range requests (used by Origin). This should make it suitable for:

 - Steam (Valve)
 - Origin (EA Games)
 - Riot Games (League of Legends)
 - Battle.net (Hearthstone, Starcraft 2, Overwatch)
 - Frontier Launchpad (Elite Dangerous, Planet Coaster)
 - Uplay (Ubisoft)
 - Windows Updates

This is the best container to use for all game caching and should be used for Steam in preference to the lancachenet/steamcache and lancachenet/generic containers.

## Usage

Unlike lancachenet/generic this service will cache all cdn services (defined in the [uklans cache-domains repo](https://github.com/uklans/cache-domains) so multiple instances are not required

## Simple Full Stack startup

To initialise a full caching setup with dns and sni proxy you can use the following script as a starting point:
```
HOST_IP=`hostname -I | cut -d' ' -f1`
docker run --restart unless-stopped --name lancache-dns --detach -p 53:53/udp -e USE_GENERIC_CACHE=true -e LANCACHE_IP=$HOST_IP lancachenet/lancache-dns:latest
docker run --restart unless-stopped --name lancache --detach -v /cache/data:/data/cache -v /cache/logs:/data/logs -p 80:80  lancachenet/monolithic:latest
docker run --restart unless-stopped --name sniproxy --detach -p 443:443 lancachenet/sniproxy:latest
echo Please configure your dhcp server to serve dns as $HOST_IP
```
Please check that `hostname -I` returns the correct IP before running this snippet


## Changing from lancachenet/steamcache and lancachenet/generic

This new container is designed to replace an array of steamcache or generic containers with a single monolithic instance. However if you currently run a steamcache or generic setup then there a few things to note

1) Your existing cache files are NOT compatible with lancachenet/monolithic, unfortunately your cache will need repriming
2) You do not need multiple containers, a single monolithic container will cache ALL cdns without collision
3) lancachenet/monolithic should be compatible with your existing container's env vars so you can use the same run command you currently use, just change to lancachenet/monolithic


## Origin and SSL

Some publishers, including Origin, use the same hostnames we're replacing for HTTPS content as well as HTTP content. We can't cache HTTPS traffic, so if you're intercepting DNS, you will need to run an SNI Proxy container on port 443 to forward on any HTTPS traffic.

Please read the [lancachenet/sniproxy](https://github.com/lancachenet/sniproxy) project for more information.

## DNS Entries

You can find a list of domains you will want to use for each service over on [uklans/cache-domains](https://github.com/uklans/cache-domains). The aim is for this to be a definitive list of all domains you might want to cache.

## Suggested Hardware

Regular commodity hardware (a single 2TB WD Black on an HP Microserver) can achieve peak throughputs of 30MB/s+ using this setup (depending on the specific content being served).

## Changing Upstream DNS

If you need to change the upstream DNS server the cache uses, these are defined by the `UPSTREAM_DNS` environment variable. The defaults are Google DNS (8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4).

```
 UPSTREAM_DNS 8.8.8.8 8.8.4.4
```

You can override these using the `-e` argument to docker run and specifying your upstream DNS servers. Multiple upstream dns servers are allowed,  separated by whitespace.

```
-e UPSTREAM_DNS="1.1.1.1 1.0.0.1"
```

## Tweaking Cache sizes

Two environment variables are available to manage both the memory and disk cache for a particular container, and are set to the following defaults.
```
CACHE_MEM_SIZE 500m
CACHE_DISK_SIZE 1000000m
```

In addition, there is an environment variable to control the max cache age

```
CACHE_MAX_AGE 3650d
````

You can override these at run time by adding the following to your docker run command.  They accept the standard nginx notation for sizes (k/m/g/t) and durations (m/h/d)

```
-e CACHE_MEM_SIZE=4000m -e CACHE_DISK_SIZE=1000g
```

## Tuning your cache
Steam in particular has some inherrent limitations caused by the adherence to the HTTP spec connection pool. As such steam download speed are highly dependent on the latency between your server and the steam cdn servers. In the event you find your initial download speed with the default settings is slow this can be resolved by allocating more IP's to your ache. We suggest adding one IP at a time to see how much gain can be had (4 seems to work for a number of people)
### Step 1: Adding IP's to your docker host
Consult your OS documentation in order to add additional IP addresses onto your docker cache host machine
### Step 2: Adding IP's to your cache container
In order for this to work you need to add the port maps onto the relevant cdn container (for example steam). 
* If you are using `lancachenet/monolithic` then using `-p 80:80` should be sufficient as per the documentation. 
* If you are using `lancachenet/generic` or `lancachenet/steamcache` then add multiple `-p <IPadddress>:80:80` for each IP you have added. For example `-p 10.10.1.30:80:80 -p 10.10.1.31:80:80`
### Step 3: Informing lancache-dns of the extra IP's
Finally we need to inform lancache-dns that STEAM is now available on multiple IP addresses. This can be done on the command line using the following command `-e STEAMCACHE_IP="10.10.1.30 10.10.1.31"`. Note the quotes surrounding the multiple IP addresses.
### Step 4: Testing
Choose a game which has not been seen by the cache before (or clear your `/data/cache` folder) and start it downloading. Check to see what the maximum speed seen by your steam client is. If necessary repeat steps 1-3 with additional IPs until you see a download equivalent to your uncached steam client or no longer see an improvement vs the previous IP allocation.

## Monitoring

Access logs are written to /data/logs. If you don't particularly care about keeping them, you don't need to mount an external volume into the container.

You can tail them using:

```
docker exec -it lancache tail -f /data/logs/access.log
```

If you have mounted the volume externally then you can tail it on the host instead.

## Advice to Publishers

If you're a games publisher and you'd like LAN parties, gaming centers and other places to be able to easily cache your game updates, we reccomend the following:

 - If your content downloads are on HTTPS, you can do what Riot have done - try and resolve a specific hostname. If it resolves to a RFC1918 private address, switch your downloads to use HTTP instead.
 - Try to use hostnames specific for your HTTP download traffic.
 - Tell us the hostnames that you're using for your game traffic. We're maintaining a list at [uklans/cache-domains](https://github.com/uklans/cache-domains) and we'll accept pull requests!
 - Have your client verify the files and ensure the file they've downloaded matches the file they **should** have downloaded. This cache server acts as a man-in-the-middle so it would be good to ensure the files are correct.

 If you need any further advice, please contact us and we'll be glad to help!
